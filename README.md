## Description:

### Data :

Static geographical information of CityBike‘s stations in Brisbane (“Brisbane_CityBike.json”)

### Instructions:

Propose a script to perform a clustering based on either the location or characteristics of bike stations. 
The code should be launched by a UNIX like command. It should be developed as close as a real industrialized process (well documented, parameters easily modifiable, readable logging, etc.).

### Languages :

Python3

### Deliveries :

*   **Code**: A zip file containing all your code or a link to a Github repository
*   **Readme**: command line to launch the job, and short description of your program
*   **Output**: directory with the clustering result
